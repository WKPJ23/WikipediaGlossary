Term,Definition
Gene-culture coevolution,"Dual inheritance theory (DIT), also known as gene–culture coevolution or biocultural evolution, was developed in the 1960s through early 1980s to explain how human behaviour is a product of two different and interacting evolutionary processes: genetic evolution and cultural evolution."
Evolutionary anthropology,"Evolutionary anthropology, the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human physiology and human behaviour and of the relation between hominids and non-hominid primates, builds on natural science and on social science."
Forensic anthropology,"Forensic anthropology is the application of the anatomical science of anthropology and its various subfields, including forensic archaeology and forensic taphonomy, in a legal setting."
Human behavioral ecology,Human behavioural ecology (HBE) or human evolutionary ecology applies the principles of evolutionary theory and optimization to the study of human behavioural and cultural diversity.
Human evolution,Human evolution is the evolutionary process within the history of primates that led to the emergence of Homo sapiens as a distinct species of the hominid family that includes all the great apes.
Medical anthropology,"Medical anthropology studies ""human health and disease, health care systems, and biocultural adaptation""."
Molecular anthropology,"Molecular anthropology, also known as genetic anthropology, is the study of how molecular biology has contributed to the understanding of human evolution."
Neuroanthropology,Neuroanthropology is the study of the relationship between culture and the brain.
Nutritional anthropology,"Nutritional anthropology is the study of the interplay between human biology, economic systems, nutritional status and food security."
Paleoanthropology,"Paleoanthropology or paleo-anthropology is a branch of paleontology and anthropology which seeks to understand the early development of anatomically modern humans, a process known as hominization, through the reconstruction of evolutionary kinship lines within the family Hominidae, working from biological evidence (such as petrified skeletal remains, bone fragments, footprints) and cultural evidence (such as stone tools, artifacts, and settlement localities)."
Population genetics,"Population genetics is a subfield of genetics that deals with genetic differences within and among populations, and is a part of evolutionary biology."
Primatology,Primatology is the scientific study of non-human primates.
